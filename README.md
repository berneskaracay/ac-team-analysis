Data Access and Security Considerations

JIRA ticketing info must be accessible by analyst

For internal AC analyses only

Objective - We would like to keep tabs on JIRA workflow and current practices to optimize our planning and execution. The metrics below will establish a baseline. Further metrics may be added to compare one quarter to the next.

Environment

Use JIRA Search tool

narrow to Analytics Core Board

blank keyword search terms

Select Export -> All columns/fields

Note: first run’s raw data is attached to this ticket.

Metrics Requested

Completion - excluding ongoing/recurring tickets

Count total tickets closed in previous quarter (excluding ongoing, recurring)

Percentage tickets closed of those submitted during the quarter

Movement  - excluding ongoing/recurring tickets

How long each ticket spent in each stage (mean, median, range)

Efficiency - excluding ongoing/recurring tickets

How long a ticket took from opening to close (Status “Done”) (mean, median, range)

How many comments a ticket had, on average - measuring activity/back-and-forth (count)

Cleanliness  - excluding ongoing/recurring tickets

How many tickets (count) missing:

Due Date

Open Date

Notebook attachment

Most common requesters - include all tickets from previous quarter

Use ticket title to build frequency table (or bar chart) of count by requester, descending - if multiple requesters, count as separate requesters

Most common types of requests - include all tickets from previous quarter

Organize by ticket title tag first - count how many Ad Hoc, how many recurring, etc. - include any tickets opened or moved during that quarter

Organize by looking at subject matter (if you can tell by looking at the ticket), put into subject matter buckets (e.g., “CDR Data Quality Investigation”, “Counts Request”, etc.)

Analysis - list tickets with ticket numbers and links to the ticket that are representative of the most common requests and where the code should be stored as a standard algorithm (e.g., UBR count requests) - basically, should we be standardizing a certain type of request because we are getting it so often

Note: this can be separate from refreshable dashboard if needed, hard to automate

Break down (count, bar chart) by Environment used - e.g., RDR v. CDR

Break down by type of deliverable requested - Google sheet, executive summary, dashboard, notebook, etc. (count, bar chart)

Busy season - use all tickets since the inception of the board

Line chart to capture time trends (bucket by week?) of tickets opened

One version with recurring/ongoing tickets included

One version WITHOUT recurring/ongoing tickets included

Visualizations Requested

Visualizations referenced above should be refreshable each quarter.

If you are interested in playing with more advanced visuals or think a different type of visual may better suit the metrics above, let me know!
